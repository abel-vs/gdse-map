            <h2>General Tips</h2>

            Working in a team with team members from many different cultures can be challenging. Therefore we have compiled some general tips and tricks for working in a multicultural team.

            Be mindful of cultural differences without relying on stereotypes. Frequently remind yourself that:
            <ul>
                <li>Each team member has a unique way of working and communicating.</li>
                <li>Culture shapes behaviour but does not dictate it.</li>
                <li>Overcome language and cultural barriers.</li>
                <li>Choose the language the majority feels comfortable with, this language should be used in all meetings and formal events.</li>
                <li>If colleagues are not fluent in a specific language, avoid using it.</li>
                <li>Schedule a moment for the entire team to be together, and do this regularly.</li>
                <li>Consider different communication styles. (see below)</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Communication Style</h2>

            Being an effective communicator is vital to being able to efficiently work together with a multicultural team.
            <br />
            The key to being an effective communicator is understanding the communication style of the colleague/team member you are working with.
            <br />
            We distinct cultures and their communication styles with high context and low context
            <ul>
                <li>High-context: Good communication is sophisticated, nuanced, and layered. Messages are both spoken and read between the lines. Messages are often implied but not plainly expressed.</li>
                <li>Low-context: Good communication is precise, simple, and clear. Messages are expressed and understood at face value. Repetition is appreciated if it helps clarify the communication.</li>
            </ul>
            Research has shown that in multicultural teams, high-context communication gets lost since high-context communication works best when two people are from the same culture.
            <br/>
            Therefore multicultural teams need low-context processes.
            <br/>
            To ensure that every team member understands each other, an explicit level of verification is recommended, to take place after every meeting and individual phone call:
            <ul>
                <li>One person recaps the key points orally, with the task rotating from each team member to another.</li>
                <li>Each person would summarize orally what he would do next.</li>
                <li>One person would send out a written recap, again on a rotating basis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Time management</h2>

            Time management is an essential aspect of working with a team in a distributed setting.
            <br />
            Time management entails managing different time zones, and managing how much time every team member is spending on tasks.
            <br />
            Tips to optimize time management in a distributed team:
            <ul>
                <li>Make all team members use a time management app, such as Toggl or Clockify. This will help you keep track of progress and productivity, even when dealing with team members in different time zones.</li>
                <li>Encourage flexible working hours. This way, team members can take time for their personal life, and still have face-to-face meetings with a team in a different time zone.</li>
                <li>Allow for synchronous and asynchronous communication. Face-to-face and in-person is always preferred, however when dealing with different time zones, one has to use asynchronous communication as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
